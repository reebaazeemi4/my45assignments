// TASK 41
// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = magicians[i] + 'the great';
    }
}
var Magicians2 = ["Naina", "zainab", "Ayla"];
make_great(Magicians2);
show_magicians(Magicians2);
